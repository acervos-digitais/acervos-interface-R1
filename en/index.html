    To Use: >-
      Choose one or more collections and a type of visualization to start. Use the filters to refine the searches and the visualizations menu to create different arrangements from the filtered works.
    Filters: >-
      The filters are used to select which works will be displayed. They change the number of works included in the visualizations.
    Visualizations: >-
      The visualizations present different ways to visually explore the works selected through the filters. Visualizations do not change the number of displayed works, only the order and positioning in which the works are arranged on the screen.
    Mosaics: >-
      Mosaics are images generated from the chosen filters and visualizations. Unlike the visualizations on screen, these images are not interactive.
    AI Curations: >-
      Selections made automatically by artificial intelligence, based on visual and semantic features of the artworks.
  mobile: >-
